# Interactive Dashboard UI
This project is an interactive dashboard user interface built with React, Material UI, Sass, react-circular-progressbar, and Recharts. The dashboard includes various charts, widgets, a progress bar, and a table with filter functionality.

# Features
Charts: The dashboard includes visually appealing and interactive charts created with the help of Recharts. These charts provide a visual representation of data and make it easier to understand trends and patterns.

Widgets: Various widgets are available on the dashboard, allowing users to view important metrics and information at a glance. These widgets can be customized and rearranged based on user preferences.

Progress Bar: The interactive dashboard also includes a progress bar implemented with the react-circular-progressbar library. This progress bar provides a visual representation of the progress of a specific task or goal.

Table with Filter: A table component is integrated into the dashboard, allowing users to view and filter tabular data. The filter functionality enables users to search and sort data based on specific criteria.

## Technologies Used
1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. Material UI: A popular React UI framework that provides pre-built components and styling.

3. Sass: A CSS extension language that adds features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
4. react-circular-progressbar: A circular progress bar component for React applications.

5. Recharts: A charting library built with React and D3.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/vicBuilds/Results-Admin.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd panel-datavinci

3. Install the dependencies: npm install

4. Start the development server: npm start

5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the dashboard in action.

## Usage

Once the dashboard is up and running, you can explore the different charts, widgets, progress bar, and table with filter functionality. Interact with the components to view data, filter the table, and track progress using the progress bar.
